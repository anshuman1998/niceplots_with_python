# niceplots_with_python
A repository of code I use to design my plots

## singleplot.py
It is a nice way to generate a single plot, with the necessary formatting to work with most papers. Accessing and editing most parameters has been shown.

## multiplot.py
This is an example with 3 plots stacked in one column, with a shared x and y labels. Note that while the bottom plot is used to specify the x-axis label, we use the fig.text command for the y-axis label. Also, the spacing between the plots has been removed.
